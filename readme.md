Yii 2.0 Public Preview
======================

Thank you for choosing Yii - a high-performance component-based PHP framework.

If you are looking for a production-ready PHP framework, please use
[Yii v1.1](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii).

Yii 2.0 is still under heavy development. We may make significant changes
without prior notices. **Yii 2.0 is not ready for production use yet.**
