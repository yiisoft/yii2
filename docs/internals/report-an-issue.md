Report an Issue
===============

**Do not report an issue if**

* you are asking how to use some Yii feature. You should use [the forum](http://www.yiiframework.com/forum/index.php/forum/42-general-discussions-for-yii-20/) or [chat room](http://www.yiiframework.com/chat/) for this purpose.
* your issue is about security. Please [contact us directly](http://www.yiiframework.com/security/) to report security issues.

**Avoid duplicated issues**

Before you report an issue, please search through [existing issues](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/issues) to see if your issue is already reported or fixed to make sure you are not reporting a duplicated issue. Also make sure you have the latest version of Yii and see if the issue still exists.

**Guidelines for reporting issues**

If you are certain your issue is new, please follow the guidelines below when creating the issue so that your issue can be more promptly resolved:

* Update your codebase to the latest version to see if the issue still exists;
* Provide information about PHP and Yii version, operating system, browser type and version;
* Provide **complete** error call stack if possible. A screenshot is very welcome.
