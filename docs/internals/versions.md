Yii version numbering
=====================

Releases
--------

A.B.C

A = For Yii2 it's always 2.
B = Major version. Non-BC changes with upgrade instructions.
C = BC changes and additions.

Release candidates
------------------

A.B.C-rc
A.B.C-rc2

This is when we want to do a release candidate. RC number increments till we're getting a stable release with no
critical bugs and backwards incompatibility reports.

Alphas and betas
----------------

A.B.C-alpha
A.B.C-alpha2

Alphas are unstable versions where significant bugs may and probably do exist. API isn't fixed yet and may be changed
significantly. `alpha2` etc. may or may not be released based on overall stability of code and API.

A.B.C-beta
A.B.C-beta2

Beta is more or less stable with less bugs and API instability than alphas. There still could be changes in API but
there should be a significant reason for it.
