# Yii Documentation Style Guide

Guidelines to go by when writing or editing any Yii documentation.

*This needs to be expanded.*

## General Style

* Try to use an active voice.
* Use short, declarative sentences.
* Demonstrate ideas using code as much as possible.
* Never use "we". It's the Yii development team or the Yii core team. Better yet to put things in terms of the framework or the guide.
* Use the Oxford comma (e.g., "this, that, and the other" not "this, that and the other").
* Numeric lists should be complete sentences that end with periods (or other punctuation).
* Bullet lists should be fragments that don't end with periods.

## Formatting

## References

* Yii 2.0 or Yii 2 (not Yii2 or Yii2.0)
* Each "page" of the guide is referred to as a "section".

## Capitalizations

* Web, not web
* the guide or this guide, not the Guide
