This folder contains official Yii 2 guides documentation.

To add new guide, take the following steps:

1. Create `guide-name` and put there relevant documentation;
2. If guide has more then one word in name, then it should be with dashes, like: `console-fixture.md`, `module-debug.md`;
3. If your guide is for console commands, than its name should follow convention: `console-{command}.md`;
4. If your guide is for custom modules, than its name should follow convention: `module-{moduleName}.md`.
