Console applications
====================

Yii has full featured support of console. Console application structure in Yii is very similar to web application. It
consists of one or more [[\yii\console\Controller]] (often referred to as commands). Each has one or more actions.

Usage
-----

You can execute controller action using the following syntax:

```
yii <route> [--option1=value1 --option2=value2 ... argument1 argument2 ...]
```

For example, [[yii\console\controllers\MigrateController::actionCreate()|MigrateController::actionCreate()]]
with [[yii\console\controllers\MigrateController::$migrationTable|MigrateController::$migrationTable]] set can
be called from command line like the following:

```
yii migrate/create --migrationTable=my_migration
```

In the above `yii` is console application entry script described below.

Entry script
------------

Console application entry script is typically called `yii`, located in your application root directory and contains
code like the following:

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php
/**
 * Yii console bootstrap file.
 *
 * @link http://www.yiiframework.com/
 * @copyright Copyright (c) 2008 Yii Software LLC
 * @license http://www.yiiframework.com/license/
 */

defined('YII_DEBUG') or define('YII_DEBUG', true);

// fcgi doesn't have STDIN and STDOUT defined by default
defined('STDIN') or define('STDIN', fopen('php://stdin', 'r'));
defined('STDOUT') or define('STDOUT', fopen('php://stdout', 'w'));

require(__DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php');
require(__DIR__ . '/vendor/yiisoft/yii2/Yii.php');

$config = require(__DIR__ . '/config/console.php');

$application = new yii\console\Application($config);
$exitCode = $application->run();
exit($exitCode);

```

This script is a part of your application so you're free to adjust it. The `YII_DEBUG` constant can be set `false` if you do
not want to see stacktrace on error and want to improve overall performance. In both basic and advanced application
templates it is enabled to provide more developer-friendly environment.

Configuration
-------------

As can be seen in the code above, console application uses its own config files named `console.php` so you need to
configure database connection and the rest of the components you're going to use there in that file. If web and console
application configs have a lot in common it's a good idea to move matching parts into their own config files as it was
done in advanced application template.


Creating your own console commands
----------------------------------

### Console Controller and Action

A console command is defined as a controller class extending from [[yii\console\Controller]]. In the controller class,
you define one or several actions that correspond to the sub-commands of the command. Within each action, you write code
to implement certain tasks for that particular sub-command.

When running a command, you need to specify the route to the corresponding controller action. For example,
the route `migrate/create` specifies the sub-command corresponding to the
[[yii\console\controllers\MigrateController::actionCreate()|MigrateController::actionCreate()]] action method.
If a route does not contain an action ID, the default action will be executed.

### Options

By overriding the [[yii\console\Controller::globalOptions()]] method, you can specify options that are available
to a console command. The method should return a list of public property names of the controller class.
When running a command, you may specify the value of an option using the syntax `--OptionName=OptionValue`.
This will assign `OptionValue` to the `OptionName` property of the controller class.

### Arguments

Besides options, a command can also receive arguments. The arguments will be passed as the parameters to the action
method corresponding to the requested sub-command. The first argument corresponds to the first parameter, the second
corresponds to the second, and so on. If there are not enough arguments are provided, the corresponding parameters
may take the declared default values, or if they do not have default value the command will exit with an error.

You may use `array` type hint to indicate that an argument should be treated as an array. The array will be generated
by splitting the input string by commas.

The follow examples show how to declare arguments:

```php
class ExampleController extends \yii\console\Controller
{
	// The command "yii example/create test" will call "actionCreate('test')"
	public function actionCreate($name) { ... }

	// The command "yii example/index city" will call "actionIndex('city', 'name')"
	// The command "yii example/index city id" will call "actionIndex('city', 'id')"
	public function actionIndex($category, $order = 'name') { ... }

	// The command "yii example/add test" will call "actionAdd(['test'])"
	// The command "yii example/add test1,test2" will call "actionAdd(['test1', 'test2'])"
	public function actionAdd(array $name) { ... }
}
```


### Exit Code

Using return codes is the best practice of console application development. If command returns `0` it means everything
is OK. If it is a number more than zero, we have an error and integer returned is the error code.
