Security
========

Good security is vital to the health and success of any application. Unfortunately, many developers cut corners when it
comes to security, either due to a lack of understanding or because implementation is too much of a hurdle. To make your
Yii powered application as secure as possible, Yii has included several excellent and easy to use security features.

* [Authentication](security-authentication.md)
* [Authorization](security-authorization.md)
* [Working with Passwords](security-passwords.md)
* [Cryptography](security-cryptography.md)
* [Views security](structure-views.md#security)
* [Auth Clients](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-authclient/blob/master/docs/guide/README.md)
* [Best Practices](security-best-practices.md)
* [Trusted proxies and headers](runtime-requests.md#trusted-proxies)
