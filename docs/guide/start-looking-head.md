Looking Ahead
=============

To this end, you have created a complete Yii application, and you have learned how to implement some commonly
needed features, such as getting data from users using an HTML form, fetching data from database and
displaying it in a paginated fashion. You have also learned how to use [Gii](tool-gii.md) to generate
code automatically, which turns programming into a task as simple as just filling out some forms. In this
section, we will summarize the resources about Yii that help you be more productive when using Yii.

* Documentation
    - The Definitive Guide:
      As the name indicates, the guide precisely defines how Yii should work and gives you a general guidance
      about using Yii. It is the single most important Yii tutorial that you should read through
      before writing any Yii code.
    - The Class Reference:
      This specifies the usage of every class provided by Yii. It should be mainly used when you are writing
      code and want to understand the usage of a particular class, method, property.
    - The Wiki Articles:
      The wiki articles are written by Yii users based on their own experiences. Most of them are written
      like cookbook recipes which show how to solve particular problems using Yii. While the quality of these
      articles may be as good as the Definitive Guide, they are useful in that they cover broader topics
      and can often provide to you ready-to-use solutions.
    - Books
* [Extensions](http://www.yiiframework.com/extensions/):
  Yii boasts a library of thousands of user-contributed extensions that can be easily plugged into your applications
  and make your application development even faster and easier.
