Acceptance Tests
================

Acceptance test verifies scenarios from a user's perspective. The application tested is accessed via either PhpBrowser or
a real browser. In both cases the browsers are communicating via HTTP so application should be served via web server.

Acceptance testing is implemented with the help of Codeception framework which has a nice documentation about it:

- [Codeception for Yii framework](https://codeception.com/for/yii)
- [Codeception Acceptance Tests](https://codeception.com/docs/03-AcceptanceTests)

## Running basic and advanced template tests

If you've started with advanced template, please refer to ["testing" guide](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced/blob/master/docs/guide/start-testing.md)
for more details about running tests.  

If you've started with basic template, check its [README "testing" section](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-basic/blob/master/README.md#testing).
