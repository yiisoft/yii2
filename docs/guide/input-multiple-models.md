Complex Forms with Multiple Models
==================================

In complex user interfaces it can happen that a user has to fill in data in one form that
has to be saved in different tables in the database. The concept of Yii forms allows you to
build these forms with nearly no more complexity compared to single model forms.

Same as with one model you follow the following schema for validation on the server side:

1. instantiate model classes
2. populate the models attributes with input data
3. validate all models
4. If validation passes for all models, save them
5. If validation fails or no data has been submitted, display the form by passing all model instances to the view

In the following we show an example for using multiple models in a form... TBD
