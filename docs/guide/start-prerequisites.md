# What do you need to know

Yii learning curve is not as steep as other PHP frameworks but still it requires some beforehand knowledge.

## PHP

Yii is a PHP framework so make sure you [read and understand language reference](http://php.net/manual/en/langref.php).

## Object oriented programming

Basic understanding of object oriented programming is required. If you're not familiar with it, check one of the many
tutorials available such as [the one from tuts+](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/object-oriented-php-for-beginners--net-12762).

Note that the more complicated your application is the more advanced OOP concepts your should learn in order to successfully
manage that complexity.

## Command line and composer

Yii extensively uses de-facto standard PHP package manager, [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) so make sure you read
and understand its guide. If you are not familiar with using command line it is time to start trying. Once you'll
learn the basics you'll never want to work without it.
