Shared Hosting Environment
==========================

Shared hosting environments are often quite limited about configuration and directory structure. Still in most cases you can run Yii 2.0 on a shared hosting environment with a few adjustements.

Deploying a basic application
---------------------------

Since in a shared hosting environment there's typically only one webroot, use the basic project template if you can. Refer to the [Installing Yii chapter](start-installation.md) and install the basic project template locally. After you have the application working locally, we'll make some adjustments so it can be hosted on your shared hosting server.

### Renaming webroot <span id="renaming-webroot"></span>

Connect to your shared host using FTP or by other means. You will probably see something like the following.
 
```
config
logs
www
```

In the above, `www` is your webserver webroot directory. It could be named differently. Common names are: `www`, `htdocs`, and `public_html`.

The webroot in our basic project template is named `web`. Before uploading the application to your webserver rename your local webroot to match your server, i.e., from `web` to `www`, `public_html` or whatever the name of your hosting webroot.

### FTP root directory is writeable

If you can write to the root level directory i.e. where `config`, `logs` and `www` are, then upload `assets`, `commands` etc. as is to the root level directory.

### Add extras for webserver <span id="add-extras-for-webserver"></span>

If your webserver is Apache you'll need to add an `.htaccess` file with the following content to `web` (or `public_html` or whatever) (where the `index.php` file is located):

```
Options +FollowSymLinks
IndexIgnore */*

RewriteEngine on

# if a directory or a file exists, use it directly
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

# otherwise forward it to index.php
RewriteRule . index.php
```

In case of nginx you should not need any extra config files.

### Check requirements

In order to run Yii, your webserver must meet its requirements. The very minimum requirement is PHP 5.4. In order to check the requirements copy `requirements.php` from your root directory into the webroot directory and run it via browser using
`http://example.com/requirements.php` URL. Don't forget to delete the file afterwards.

Deploying an advanced application
---------------------------------

Deploying an advanced application to shared hosting is a bit trickier than a basic application because it has two webroots, which shared hosting webservers don't support. We will need to adjust the directory structure.

### Move entry scripts into single webroot

First of all we need a webroot directory. Create a new directory and name it to match your hosting webroot name as described in [Renaming webroot](#renaming-webroot) above, e.g., `www` or `public_html` or the like. Then create the following structure where `www` is the hosting webroot directory you just created:

```
www
    admin
backend
common
console
environments
frontend
...
```

`www` will be our frontend directory so move the contents of `frontend/web` into it. Move the contents of `backend/web` into `www/admin`. In each case you will need to adjust the paths in `index.php` and `index-test.php`.

### Separate sessions and cookies

Originally the backend and frontend are intended to run at different domains. When weâ€™re moving it all to the same domain the frontend and backend will be sharing the same cookies, creating a clash. It order to fix it, adjust backend application config
`backend/config/main.php` as follows:

```php
'components' => [
    'request' => [
        'csrfParam' => '_backendCSRF',
        'csrfCookie' => [
            'httpOnly' => true,
            'path' => '/admin',
        ],
    ],
    'user' => [
        'identityCookie' => [
            'name' => '_backendIdentity',
            'path' => '/admin',
            'httpOnly' => true,
        ],
    ],
    'session' => [
        'name' => 'BACKENDSESSID',
        'cookieParams' => [
            'path' => '/admin',
        ],
    ],
],
```
