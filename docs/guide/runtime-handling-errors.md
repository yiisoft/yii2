Error Handling
==============

> Note: This section is under development.

Error handling in Yii is different than handling errors in plain PHP. First of all, Yii will convert all non-fatal errors
to *exceptions*:

```php
use yii\base\ErrorException;
use Yii;

try {
    10/0;
} catch (ErrorException $e) {
    Yii::warning("Tried dividing by zero.");
}

// execution may continue
```

As demonstrated above you may handle errors using `try`-`catch`.

Second, even fatal errors in Yii are rendered in a nice way. This means that in debugging mode, you can trace the causes
of fatal errors in order to more quickly identify the cause of the problem.


Rendering errors in a dedicated controller action
-------------------------------------------------

The default Yii error page is great when developing a site, and is acceptable for production sites if `YII_DEBUG`
is turned off in your bootstrap `index.php` file. But you may want to customize the default error page to make it
more suitable for your project.

The easiest way to create a custom error page it is to use a dedicated controller action for error rendering. First,
you'll need to configure the `errorHandler` component in the application's configuration:

```php
// ...
'components' => [
    // ...
    'errorHandler' => [
        'errorAction' => 'site/error',
    ],
]
```

With that configuration in place, whenever an error occurs, Yii will execute the `error`-action of the `site`-controller.
That action should look for an exception and, if present, render the proper view file, passing along the exception:

```php
public function actionError()
{
    $exception = \Yii::$app->errorHandler->exception;
    if ($exception !== null) {
        return $this->render('error', ['exception' => $exception]);
    }
}
```

Next, you would create the `views/site/error.php` file, which would make use of the exception. The exception object has
the following properties:

- `statusCode`: the HTTP status code (e.g. 403, 500). Available for [[yii\web\HttpException|HTTP exceptions]] only.
- `code`: the code of the exception.
- `message`: the error message.
- `file`: the name of the PHP script file where the error occurs.
- `line`: the line number of the code where the error occurs.
- `trace`: the call stack of the error.


Rendering errors without a dedicated controller action
------------------------------------------------------

Instead of creating a dedicated action within the Site controller, you could just indicate to Yii what class should
be used to handle errors:

```php
public function actions()
{
    return [
        'error' => [
            'class' => 'yii\web\ErrorAction',
        ],
    ];
}
```

After associating the class with the error as in the above, define the `views/site/error.php` file, which will
automatically be used. The view will be passed three variables:

- `$name`: the error name
- `$message`: the error message
- `$exception`: the exception being handled

The `$exception` object will have the same properties as outlined above.
