Yii 2 Advanced Application Template
===================================

**NOTE** Yii 2 and the relevant applications and extensions are still under heavy
development. We may make significant changes without prior notices. Please do not
use them for production. Please consider using [Yii v1.1](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii)
if you have a project to be deployed for production soon.


Thank you for using Yii 2 Advanced Application Template - an application template
that works out-of-box and can be easily customized to fit for your needs.

Yii 2 Advanced Application Template is best suitable for large projects requiring frontend and backend separation,
deployment in different environments, configuration nesting etc.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by Yii is that your Web server supports PHP 5.3.?.

In order for captcha to work you need either GD2 extension or ImageMagick PHP extension.

INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may download it from
[http://getcomposer.org/](http://getcomposer.org/) or run the following command on Linux/Unix/MacOS:

~~~
curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
~~~

You can then install the application using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar create-project --stability=dev yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced yii-advanced
~~~


### Install from an Archive File

This is not currently available. We will provide it when Yii 2 is formally released.


### Install from development repository

If you've cloned the [Yii 2 framework main development repository](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2) you
can bootstrap your application with:

~~~
cd yii2/apps/advanced
php composer.phar create-project
~~~

*Note: If the above command fails with `[RuntimeException] Not enough arguments.` run
`php composer.phar self-update` to obtain an updated version of composer which supports creating projects
from local packages.*


GETTING STARTED
---------------

After you install the application, you have to conduct the following steps to initialize
the installed application. You only need to do these once for all.

1. Execute the `init` command and select `dev` as environment.
2. Create a new database. It is assumed that MySQL InnoDB is used. If not, adjust `console/migrations/m130524_201442_init.php`.
3. In `common/config/params.php` set your database details in `components.db` values.

Now you should be able to access:

- the frontend using the URL `http://localhost/yii-advanced/frontend/web/`
- the backend using the URL `http://localhost/yii-advanced/backend/web/`

assuming `yii-advanced` is directly under the document root of your Web server.
