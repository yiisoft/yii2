# you can use WebDriver instead of PhpBrowser to test javascript and ajax.
# This will require you to install selenium. See http://codeception.com/docs/04-AcceptanceTests#Selenium
# "restart" option is used by the WebDriver to start each time per test-file new session and cookies,
# it is useful if you want to login in your app in each test.
