How to Upgrade JQuery UI
========================

To upgrade JQuery UI, use [JUI Download Builder](http://jqueryui.com/download/) and toggle all options.
Choose the `Smoothness` theme, download and unpack.

The following files are needed:

* UI Core: all JS files
* Interactions: all JS files
* Widgets: all JS files
* DatePicker I18N: only the combined file is needed, and it should be renamed as `jquery.ui.datepicker-i18n.js`
* Effects: only the combined file is needed, and it should be renamed as `jquery.ui.effect-all.js`
* Theme: Only the combined CSS file and the image files are needed. Rename the CSS file as `jquery.ui.css`.
