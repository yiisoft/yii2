Faker Extension for Yii 2
=========================

This extension provides a [`Faker`](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) fixture command for Yii 2.


Installation
------------

The preferred way to install this extension is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org/download/).

Either run

```
php composer.phar require --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-faker "*"
```

or add

```json
"yiisoft/yii2-faker": "*"
```

to the require section of your composer.json.


Usage
-----

To use this extension,  simply add the following code in your application configuration (console.php):

```php
'controllerMap' => [
    'fixture' => [
        'class' => 'yii\faker\FixtureController',
    ],
],
```
Set valid ```test``` alias in your console config, for example for ```basic``` application template, this should be added
to ```console.php``` config: ```Yii::setAlias('tests', __DIR__ . '/../tests');```
To start using this command you need to be familiar (read guide) for the [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) library and
generate fixtures template files, according to the given format:

```php
//users.php file under template path (by default @tests/unit/templates/fixtures)
return [
    [
        'table_column0' => 'faker_formatter',
        ...
        'table_columnN' => 'other_faker_formatter'
        'body' => function ($fixture, $faker, $index) {
            //set needed fixture fields based on different conditions

            $fixture['body'] = $faker->sentence(7,true); //generate sentence exact with 7 words.
            return $fixture;
        }
    ],
];
```

If you use callback as a attribute value, then it will be called as shown with three parameters:

* ```$fixture``` - current fixture array. 
* ```$faker``` - faker generator instance
* ```$index``` - current fixture index. For example if user need to generate 3 fixtures for user table, it will be 0..2.

After you set all needed fields in callback, you need to return $fixture array back from the callback.

Another example of valid template:

```php
return [
    'name' => 'firstName',
    'phone' => 'phoneNumber',
    'city' => 'city',
    'password' => function ($fixture, $faker, $index) {
        $fixture['password'] = Yii::$app->getSecurity()->generatePasswordHash('password_' . $index);
        return $fixture;
    },
    'auth_key' => function ($fixture, $faker, $index) {
        $fixture['auth_key'] = Yii::$app->getSecurity()->generateRandomKey();
        return $fixture;
    },
];
```

After you prepared needed templates for tables you can simply generate your fixtures via command

```php
//generate fixtures for the users table based on users fixture template
php yii fixture/generate users

//also a short version of this command ("generate" action is default)
php yii fixture users

//to generate several fixtures data files, use "," as a separator, for example:
php yii fixture users,profile,some_other_name
```

In the code above "users" is template name, after this command run, new file named same as template
will be created under the fixtures path (by default ```@tests/unit/fixtures```) folder.
You can generate fixtures for all templates by specifying keyword ```all```. You dont need to worry about if data file
directory already created or not, if not - it will be created by these command.

```php
php yii fixture/generate all
```

This command will generate fixtures for all template files that are stored under template path and 
store fixtures under fixtures path with file names same as templates names.
You can specify how many fixtures per file you need by the second parameter. In the code below we generate
all fixtures and in each file there will be 3 rows (fixtures).

```php
php yii fixture/generate all 3
```
You can specify different options of this command:

```php
//generate fixtures in russian language
php yii fixture/generate users 5 --language='ru_RU'

//read templates from the other path
php yii fixture/generate all --templatePath='@app/path/to/my/custom/templates'

//generate fixtures into other directory.
php yii fixture/generate all --fixtureDataPath='@tests/acceptance/fixtures/data'
```

You also can create your own data providers for custom tables fields, see [Faker](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) library guide for more info;
After you created custom provider, for example:

```php
class Book extends \Faker\Provider\Base
{
    public function title($nbWords = 5)
    {
        $sentence = $this->generator->sentence($nbWords);
        return mb_substr($sentence, 0, mb_strlen($sentence) - 1);
    }

    public function ISBN()
    {
        return $this->generator->randomNumber(13);
    }

 }
```

You can use it by adding it to the ```$providers``` property of the current command. In your console.php config:

```php
'controllerMap' => [
    'fixture' => [
        'class' => 'yii\faker\FixtureController',
        'providers' => [
            'app\tests\unit\faker\providers\Book',
        ],
    ],
]
```
