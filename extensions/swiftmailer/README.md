SwiftMailer Extension for Yii 2
===============================

This extension provides a `SwiftMailer` mail solution for Yii 2.

To use this extension,  simply add the following code in your application configuration:

```php
return [
    //....
    'components' => [
        'mailer' => [
            'class' => 'yii\swiftmailer\Mailer',
        ],
    ],
];
```

You can then send an email as follows:

```php
Yii::$app->mailer->compose('contact/html')
     ->setFrom('from@domain.com')
     ->setTo($form->email)
     ->setSubject($form->subject)
     ->send();
```

For further instructions refer to the related section in the Yii Definitive Guide.
