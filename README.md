Yii 2.0 Public Preview
======================

Thank you for choosing Yii - a high-performance component-based PHP framework.

If you are looking for a production-ready PHP framework, please use
[Yii v1.1](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii).

Yii 2.0 is still under heavy development. We may make significant changes
without prior notices. **Yii 2.0 is not ready for production use yet.**

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by Yii is that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

For 1.1 users, you may refer to [Upgrading from Yii 1.1](docs/guide/upgrade-from-v1.md)
to have a general idea of what has changed in 2.0.

[Definitive Guide draft](docs/guide/index.md) is available. It's not complete yet but main parts are already OK.
