Yii PHP Framework Version 2
===========================
test
Thank you for choosing Yii 2 - a modern PHP framework designed for professional Web development.

Yii 2 is a complete rewrite of its previous version Yii 1.1 which is one of the most popular PHP frameworks.
Yii 2 inherits the main spirit behind Yii for being simple, fast and highly extensible.
Yii 2 requires PHP 5.4 and embraces the best practices and protocols found in modern Web application development.


**Yii 2 is not ready for production use yet.** We may make significant changes without prior notices.
We expect to make the first stable release of Yii 2 in the middle of 2014.

If you mainly want to learn Yii with no real project development requirement, we highly recommend
you start with Yii 2 as it will be our main focus for the next few years.

If you have a real project with tight schedule, you should stick to [Yii 1.1](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii)
which is the latest stable release of Yii.
