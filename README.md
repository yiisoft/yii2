Thank you for choosing Yii 2 - a modern PHP framework designed for professional Web development.

Yii 2 is a complete rewrite of its previous version Yii 1.1 which is one of the most popular PHP frameworks.
Yii 2 inherits the main spirit behind Yii for being simple, fast and highly extensible.

REQUIREMENTS

The minimum requirement by Yii is that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.


DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Yii 2.0 has a [Definitive Guide](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/guide-index.html) and 
a [Class Reference](http://www.yiiframework.com/doc-2.0/index.html) which cover every detail of Yii.

There is also a [PDF version](http://stuff.cebe.cc/yii2-guide.pdf) of the Definitive Guide
and a [Definitive Guide Mirror](http://stuff.cebe.cc/yii2docs/) which update every 15 minutes.

For 1.1 users, you may refer to [Upgrading from Yii 1.1](docs/guide/intro-upgrade-from-v1.md)
to have a general idea of what has changed in 2.0.
