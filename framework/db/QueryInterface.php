     */
    public function indexBy($column);

    /**
     * Sets the WHERE part of the query.
     *
     * The `$condition` specified as an array can be in one of the following two formats:
     *
     * - hash format: `['column1' => value1, 'column2' => value2, ...]`
     * - operator format: `[operator, operand1, operand2, ...]`
     *
     * A condition in hash format represents the following SQL expression in general:
     * `column1=value1 AND column2=value2 AND ...`. In case when a value is an array,
     * an `IN` expression will be generated. And if a value is `null`, `IS NULL` will be used
     * in the generated expression. Below are some examples:
     *
     * - `['type' => 1, 'status' => 2]` generates `(type = 1) AND (status = 2)`.
     * - `['id' => [1, 2, 3], 'status' => 2]` generates `(id IN (1, 2, 3)) AND (status = 2)`.
     * - `['status' => null]` generates `status IS NULL`.
     *
     * A condition in operator format generates the SQL expression according to the specified operator, which
     * can be one of the following:
     *
     * - **and**: the operands should be concatenated together using `AND`. For example,
     *   `['and', 'id=1', 'id=2']` will generate `id=1 AND id=2`. If an operand is an array,
     *   it will be converted into a string using the rules described here. For example,
     *   `['and', 'type=1', ['or', 'id=1', 'id=2']]` will generate `type=1 AND (id=1 OR id=2)`.
     *   The method will *not* do any quoting or escaping.
     *
     * - **or**: similar to the `and` operator except that the operands are concatenated using `OR`. For example,
     *   `['or', ['type' => [7, 8, 9]], ['id' => [1, 2, 3]]]` will generate `(type IN (7, 8, 9) OR (id IN (1, 2, 3)))`.
     *
     * - **not**: this will take only one operand and build the negation of it by prefixing the query string with `NOT`.
     *   For example `['not', ['attribute' => null]]` will result in the condition `NOT (attribute IS NULL)`.
     *
     * - **between**: operand 1 should be the column name, and operand 2 and 3 should be the
     *   starting and ending values of the range that the column is in.
     *   For example, `['between', 'id', 1, 10]` will generate `id BETWEEN 1 AND 10`.
     *
     * - **not between**: similar to `between` except the `BETWEEN` is replaced with `NOT BETWEEN`
     *   in the generated condition.
     *
     * - **in**: operand 1 should be a column or DB expression, and operand 2 be an array representing
     *   the range of the values that the column or DB expression should be in. For example,
     *   `['in', 'id', [1, 2, 3]]` will generate `id IN (1, 2, 3)`.
     *   The method will properly quote the column name and escape values in the range.
     *
     *   To create a composite `IN` condition you can use and array for the column name and value, where the values are indexed by the column name:
     *   `['in', ['id', 'name'], [['id' => 1, 'name' => 'foo'], ['id' => 2, 'name' => 'bar']] ]`.
     *
     *   You may also specify a sub-query that is used to get the values for the `IN`-condition:
     *   `['in', 'user_id', (new Query())->select('id')->from('users')->where(['active' => 1])]`
     *
     * - **not in**: similar to the `in` operator except that `IN` is replaced with `NOT IN` in the generated condition.
     *
     * - **like**: operand 1 should be a column or DB expression, and operand 2 be a string or an array representing
     *   the values that the column or DB expression should be like.
     *   For example, `['like', 'name', 'tester']` will generate `name LIKE '%tester%'`.
     *   When the value range is given as an array, multiple `LIKE` predicates will be generated and concatenated
     *   using `AND`. For example, `['like', 'name', ['test', 'sample']]` will generate
     *   `name LIKE '%test%' AND name LIKE '%sample%'`.
     *   The method will properly quote the column name and escape special characters in the values.
     *   Sometimes, you may want to add the percentage characters to the matching value by yourself, you may supply
     *   a third operand `false` to do so. For example, `['like', 'name', '%tester', false]` will generate `name LIKE '%tester'`.
     *
     * - **or like**: similar to the `like` operator except that `OR` is used to concatenate the `LIKE`
     *   predicates when operand 2 is an array.
     *
     * - **not like**: similar to the `like` operator except that `LIKE` is replaced with `NOT LIKE`
     *   in the generated condition.
     *
     * - **or not like**: similar to the `not like` operator except that `OR` is used to concatenate
     *   the `NOT LIKE` predicates.
     *
     * - **exists**: operand 1 is a query object that used to build an `EXISTS` condition. For example
     *   `['exists', (new Query())->select('id')->from('users')->where(['active' => 1])]` will result in the following SQL expression:
     *   `EXISTS (SELECT "id" FROM "users" WHERE "active"=1)`.
     *
     * - **not exists**: similar to the `exists` operator except that `EXISTS` is replaced with `NOT EXISTS` in the generated condition.
     *
     * - Additionally you can specify arbitrary operators as follows: A condition of `['>=', 'id', 10]` will result in the
     *   following SQL expression: `id >= 10`.
     *
     * **Note that this method will override any existing WHERE condition. You might want to use [[andWhere()]] or [[orWhere()]] instead.**
