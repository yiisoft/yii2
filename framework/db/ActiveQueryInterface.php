 * A class implementing this interface should also use [[ActiveQueryTrait]] and [[ActiveRelationTrait]].

     * Customer::find()->with('orders', 'country')->all();
     * // find customers together with their orders and the orders' shipping address
     * Customer::find()->with('orders.address')->all();
     * // find customers together with their country and orders of status 1
     * Customer::find()->with([

     *         $query->andWhere('status = 1');
