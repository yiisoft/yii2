/**
 * Migration is the base class for representing a database migration.
 *
 * Migration is designed to be used together with the "yii migrate" command.
 *
 * Each child class of Migration represents an individual database migration which
 * is identified by the child class name.
 *
 * Within each migration, the [[up()]] method should be overridden to contain the logic
 * for "upgrading" the database; while the [[down()]] method for the "downgrading"
 * logic. The "yii migrate" command manages all available migrations in an application.
 *
 * If the database supports transactions, you may also override [[safeUp()]] and
 * [[safeDown()]] so that if anything wrong happens during the upgrading or downgrading,
 * the whole migration can be reverted in a whole.
 *
 * Note that some DB queries in some DBMS cannot be put into a transaction. For some examples,
 * please refer to [implicit commit](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/implicit-commit.html). If this is the case,
 * you should still implement `up()` and `down()`, instead.
 *
 * Migration provides a set of convenient methods for manipulating database data and schema.
 * For example, the [[insert()]] method can be used to easily insert a row of data into
 * a database table; the [[createTable()]] method can be used to create a database table.
 * Compared with the same methods in [[Command]], these methods will display extra
 * information showing the method parameters and execution time, which may be useful when
 * applying migrations.
 *
 * For more details and usage information on Migration, see the [guide article on Migration](guide:db-migrations).
