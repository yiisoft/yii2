/**
 * CacheInterface is the base interface for cache.
 *
 * A data item can be stored in the cache by calling [[set()]] and be retrieved back
 * later (in the same or different request) by [[get()]]. In both operations,
 * a key identifying the data item is required. An expiration time and/or a [[Dependency|dependency]]
 * can also be specified when calling [[set()]]. If the data item expires or the dependency
 * changes at the time of calling [[get()]], the cache will return no data.
 *
 * A typical usage pattern of cache is like the following:
 *
 * ```php
 * $key = 'demo';
 * $data = $cache->get($key);
 * if ($data === false) {
 *     // ...generate $data here...
 *     $cache->set($key, $data, $duration, $dependency);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Because CacheInterface extends the [[\ArrayAccess]] interface, it can be used like an array. For example,
 *
 * ```php
 * $cache['foo'] = 'some data';
 * echo $cache['foo'];
 * ```
 *
 * For more details and usage information on Cache, see the [guide article on caching](guide:caching-overview).
