Upgrading Instructions for Yii Framework v2
===========================================

!!!IMPORTANT!!!

The following upgrading instructions are cumulative. That is,
if you want to upgrade from version A to version C and there is
version B between A and C, you need to following the instructions
for both A and B.


Upgrade from Yii 2.0 Beta
-------------------------

* If you used `clearAll()` or `clearAllAssignments()` of `yii\rbac\DbManager`, you should replace
  them with `removeAll()` and `removeAllAssignments()` respectively.
* If you created RBAC rule classes, you should modify their `execute()` method by adding `$user`
  as the first parameter: `execute($user, $item, $params)`. The `$user` parameter represents
  the ID of the user currently being access checked. Previously, this is passed via `$params['user']`.
