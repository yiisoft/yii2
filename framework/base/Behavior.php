/**
 * Behavior is the base class for all behavior classes.
 *
 * A behavior can be used to enhance the functionality of an existing component without modifying its code.
 * In particular, it can "inject" its own methods and properties into the component
 * and make them directly accessible via the component. It can also respond to the events triggered in the component
 * and thus intercept the normal code execution.
 *
 * For more details and usage information on Behavior, see the [guide article on behaviors](guide:concept-behaviors).

     * Declares event handlers for the [[owner]]'s events.

     * Child classes may override this method to declare what PHP callbacks should
     * be attached to the events of the [[owner]] component.
     *
     * The callbacks will be attached to the [[owner]]'s events when the behavior is
     * attached to the owner; and they will be detached from the events when
     * the behavior is detached from the component.
     *
     * The callbacks can be any of the following:
     *
     * - method in this behavior: `'handleClick'`, equivalent to `[$this, 'handleClick']`
     * - object method: `[$object, 'handleClick']`
     * - static method: `['Page', 'handleClick']`
     * - anonymous function: `function ($event) { ... }`
     *

     *
     * ```php
     * [
     *     Model::EVENT_BEFORE_VALIDATE => 'myBeforeValidate',
     *     Model::EVENT_AFTER_VALIDATE => 'myAfterValidate',
     * ]
