/**
 * Component is the base class that implements the *property*, *event* and *behavior* features.
 *
 * Component provides the *event* and *behavior* features, in addition to the *property* feature which is implemented in
 * its parent class [[\yii\base\Object|Object]].
 *
 * Event is a way to "inject" custom code into existing code at certain places. For example, a comment object can trigger
 * an "add" event when the user adds a comment. We can write custom code and attach it to this event so that when the event
 * is triggered (i.e. comment will be added), our custom code will be executed.
 *
 * An event is identified by a name that should be unique within the class it is defined at. Event names are *case-sensitive*.
 *
 * One or multiple PHP callbacks, called *event handlers*, can be attached to an event. You can call [[trigger()]] to
 * raise an event. When an event is raised, the event handlers will be invoked automatically in the order they were
 * attached.
 *
 * To attach an event handler to an event, call [[on()]]:
 *
 * ```php
 * $post->on('update', function ($event) {
 *     // send email notification
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * In the above, an anonymous function is attached to the "update" event of the post. You may attach
 * the following types of event handlers:
 *
 * - anonymous function: `function ($event) { ... }`
 * - object method: `[$object, 'handleAdd']`
 * - static class method: `['Page', 'handleAdd']`
 * - global function: `'handleAdd'`
 *
 * The signature of an event handler should be like the following:
 *
 * ```php
 * function foo($event)
 * ```
 *
 * where `$event` is an [[Event]] object which includes parameters associated with the event.
 *
 * You can also attach a handler to an event when configuring a component with a configuration array.
 * The syntax is like the following:
 *
 * ```php
 * [
 *     'on add' => function ($event) { ... }
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * where `on add` stands for attaching an event to the `add` event.
 *
 * Sometimes, you may want to associate extra data with an event handler when you attach it to an event
 * and then access it when the handler is invoked. You may do so by
 *
 * ```php
 * $post->on('update', function ($event) {
 *     // the data can be accessed via $event->data
 * }, $data);
 * ```
 *
 * A behavior is an instance of [[Behavior]] or its child class. A component can be attached with one or multiple
 * behaviors. When a behavior is attached to a component, its public properties and methods can be accessed via the
 * component directly, as if the component owns those properties and methods.
 *
 * To attach a behavior to a component, declare it in [[behaviors()]], or explicitly call [[attachBehavior]]. Behaviors
 * declared in [[behaviors()]] are automatically attached to the corresponding component.
 *
 * One can also attach a behavior to a component when configuring it with a configuration array. The syntax is like the
 * following:
 *
 * ```php
 * [
 *     'as tree' => [
 *         'class' => 'Tree',
 *     ],
 * ]
 * ```
 *
 * where `as tree` stands for attaching a behavior named `tree`, and the array will be passed to [[\Yii::createObject()]]
 * to create the behavior object.
 *
 * For more details and usage information on Component, see the [guide article on components](guide:concept-components).
 *
 * @property Behavior[] $behaviors List of behaviors attached to this component. This property is read-only.
