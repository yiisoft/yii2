/**
 * Security provides a set of methods to handle common security-related tasks.
 *
 * In particular, Security supports the following features:
 *
 * - Encryption/decryption: [[encrypt()]] and [[decrypt()]]
 * - Data tampering prevention: [[hashData()]] and [[validateData()]]
 * - Password validation: [[generatePasswordHash()]] and [[validatePassword()]]
 *
 * Additionally, Security provides [[getSecretKey()]] to support generating
 * named secret keys. These secret keys, once generated, will be stored in a file
 * and made available in future requests.
