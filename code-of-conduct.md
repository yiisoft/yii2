Yii Contributor Code of Conduct
=======================

## Our Pledge

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in order to keep Yii community open and welcoming, we ask to respect all community members.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic
  addresses, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in
  a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response
to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this
Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors
that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when
an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing
a project or community include posting via an official social media account,
within project GitHub, official forum or acting as an appointed representative at
an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported
by contacting core team members. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated
and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of
an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith
may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of
the project's leadership.
